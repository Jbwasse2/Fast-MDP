#Performing a reduction is a nice way to go from having a soupy sauce into a much thicker sauce.
#In order to do make a reduction sauce you will want to first cook the stars of your dish (fish/meat/veggies/etc)
#You will want to incorporate the fond into your reduction.
#The fond is the parts of the veggies/fish/meat that are stuck to the pan after cooking and taking them out.
#Typically people will use a liquid in order to get the
#fond off of the pan and into the sauce. I recommend a veggy/chicken stock or some wine. Feel free to use cheap wine.
#At this point you will want to use a wooden spoon to pick up the fond from the bottom of the pan and incorporate into
#the reduction.
#Now is a good time to add a healthy (or more correctly, an unhealthy) amount of butter. A few tbsps will do.
#This will add a nice richness to your sauce and will help with a nicer thickness of the sauce.
#Finally, put a cover over your pan and let the sauce reduce until it reaches your ideal consistancy.
#Don't forget to taste and season your sauce apporopiately before serving!
#Feel free to reach out to me for a copy of my cooking book :D
#Now import reduce for code...
